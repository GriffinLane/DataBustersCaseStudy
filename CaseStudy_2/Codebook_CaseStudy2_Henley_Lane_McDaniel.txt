**Project Description**
For this study DataBusters has been asked to conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to help DDSAnalytics determine 
leading factors that can lead to higher attrition.  The project team will also explore existing trends and observations 
based on the data provided that may prove useful in evaluating attrition.


**Collection of the raw data**
The data set was provided to DBI by DDSAnalytics, but the actual collection method and sourcing
is unknown.


**Notes on the original (raw) data** 
Raw data in the file contains headers/variable names.  The data consists of 1470 observations containing individual 
employment details that cover a wide range of explanatory variables (35 in total).  The data provided includes both
professional and personal details, but no information is included that would allow an individual to be identified.  
Our variables differ in class and are mixed by factor, character, and integer respectively.


**Study design and data processing**
The DataBusters project team has conducted a thorough exploratory data analysis (EDA), followed by multivariate linear
regression modeling of the data provided.  In order to complete the analysis the data was organized in a manner that
would ensure that correlation was considered across all variable types.


**Guide to create the tidy data file**
1) Load the data provided by DDSAnalytics
2) Divide the data into a training set consisting of 70% of the data, and a test set consisting of the remaining 30%.
3) Parse out columns with no standard deviations.  
4) Produce 'dummy columns' for all of our factors.
5) Center and scale the data.
6) Change the column names to something more intuitive and readable.
7) Remove extra columns generated by model.matrix to make the control group one of the factor values.
8) Remove EmployeeNumber variable as unnecessary.
